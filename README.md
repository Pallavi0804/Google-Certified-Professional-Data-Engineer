### 1. Data Processing Concepts
**What is Big Data ?** => Big data is large datasets or technology to handle large data. 

**What defines Big Data ?**
We can define BigData with 3V's
1. Volume - The **scale** of information being handled by data processing system.
      
      E.g. MB, GB, TB, PT, ZB, etc.
2. Velocity - The **Speed** at which data is being processed. Ingested, analyzed, visualized.
      
      E.g. AD-HOC, Batched, Near Real-Time, Real Time, etc.
3. Variety - The **diversity** of data sources, formats and quality.
      
      E.g. Key/Valye, Tabluar data, Images, Audio, Video, Unstrctured, Mobile/Streaming Data, IOT, etc.
      
**Defining Big Data Terms**
1. Data warehouses - 
      1.1 Structured and/or Processed - Data is organized, may have been transformed, and is stored in structured way. 
      1.2 Ready to Use - Data exists in the warehouse for a defined purpose, and in a format where it is ready to be consumed.
      1.3 Rigid - Data may be easier to understand, but less up-to-date. Structures are hard to change. 
2. Data lakes - 
      2.1 Row & Unstructured - The data lake contains all row, unprocessed data, before any kind of transformation or orgnization.
      2.2 Ready to Analyze - Data is more up to date, but may require more advance
